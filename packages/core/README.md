This is a card game framework written in typescript. This package contains the framework and useful components, including functionality to display a card game in the command line.

Implementations of a card game must share a certain set of exports to be able to be run, see [Hearts](https://github.com/johnameyer/can-i-have-that/blob/master/packages/hearts/src/index.ts) for an up-to-date example.

Contributions of games to the library are welcome on the Github.
